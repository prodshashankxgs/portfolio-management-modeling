# Portfolio Management PPI Modeling Project

This project forecasts month-on-month percentage changes in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for portfolio management services using machine learning and time series analysis. The system uses market returns, macro risk factors, and fund flows to predict pricing dynamics in fee-based financial services.
