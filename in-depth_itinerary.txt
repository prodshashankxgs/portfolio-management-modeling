in-depth outline

1. Data Collection Strategy
Primary Target Variable:

PPIDF01 Index (PPI Portfolio Management, NSA) from BLS/FRED

Potential Predictor Variables:

Market Returns: S&P 500, Russell 2000, NASDAQ, VIX (volatility)
Bond Market: 10Y Treasury yield, yield curve spreads, corporate bond spreads
Fund Flows: ETF/mutual fund flow data, equity fund flows
Macro Risk Indicators: Dollar index, commodity prices, credit spreads
Market Microstructure: Trading volumes, bid-ask spreads if available
Economic Indicators: GDP growth, employment data, inflation expectations

2. Technical Architecture
Data Pipeline:

Use FRED API for most macro/financial time series
BLS API specifically for PPI data validation
Polars for all data manipulation (faster than pandas for time series operations)
Create modular functions for API calls with rate limiting
Implement data caching to avoid repeated API calls

3. Feature Engineering Approach
Lag Structure:

Test various lag lengths (1-12 months) for all predictors
Portfolio management fees often respond with delays to market conditions

Derived Features:

Rolling volatilities (1M, 3M, 6M windows)
Moving averages and momentum indicators
Regime indicators (bull/bear market flags)
Interaction terms between market stress and fund flows

Temporal Features:

Month-of-year effects (even though NSA, some patterns may exist)
Quarter-end effects (rebalancing periods)

4. Modeling Strategy
Model Hierarchy:

Baseline Models: Simple autoregressive (AR) models
Linear Models: Ridge/Lasso with lagged features
Tree-Based: Random Forest, XGBoost for non-linear relationships
Time Series Specific: Vector Autoregression (VAR), Dynamic Factor Models

Validation Framework:

Time series cross-validation (expanding window)
Out-of-sample testing on most recent 12-24 months
Walk-forward validation for real-time performance assessment

5. Analysis Framework
Exploratory Phase:

Correlation analysis between PPI MoM% and potential predictors
Lead-lag relationship analysis
Regime-dependent behavior (recession vs expansion periods)
Structural break testing

Model Diagnostics:

Feature importance analysis
Residual analysis for autocorrelation
Forecast accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, directional accuracy)
Economic significance testing

7. Key Considerations
Data Frequency Alignment:

Ensure all variables are monthly frequency
Handle different release schedules (some data released with delays)
Account for revision patterns in economic data

Economic Intuition:

Portfolio management fees tied to AUM levels
AUM affected by both market performance and fund flows
Fee compression trends in the industry
Regulatory changes affecting fee structures

Real-time Challenges:

Data availability lags (some indicators released with 1-2 month delays)
Model stability during market stress periods
Computational efficiency for frequent retrainin
